# Evolution Updates - Crossover and Best Agent Features

This document describes the new features added to the evolutionary agent simulation.

## New Features

### 1. Crossover Operator

**What it does:**
- Adds genetic crossover between two parent agents when creating offspring
- Only runs when more than one agent survives a generation
- Combines neural network weights from two different parents randomly

**How it works:**
- Uses configurable proportions to create crossover vs mutation offspring
- Default: 70% crossover offspring, 30% mutation-only offspring (configurable in config.py)
- Randomly selects two different parent agents for crossover offspring
- Creates a random mask to choose weights from either parent1 or parent2
- Then applies mutation to all crossover offspring (always happens)

**Implementation:**
- New function `create_crossover_offspring()` in `neural_network.py`
- Updated `create_next_generation()` method in `evolution.py`
- Crossover only occurs when `len(survivors) > 1`

### 2. Best Agent Tracking and Saving

**What it does:**
- Tracks the best performing agent across all generations based on average performance
- Automatically saves the best agent when simulation completes
- Provides methods to save/load the best agent

**How it works:**
- `EvolutionManager` now tracks `best_agent_ever` and `best_fitness_ever`
- Updates best agent whenever a new average fitness record is achieved
- Best agent selection uses multi-run evaluation results (average performance)
- Saves complete agent state including neural network weights
- Automatically saves to `best_agent.pth` when simulation ends

**New Methods:**
- `save_best_agent(filename)` - Save best agent to file
- `load_best_agent(filename)` - Load best agent from file
- `_create_agent_copy(agent)` - Create deep copy of agent

### 3. Best Agent Test Script

**What it does:**
- Loads and runs the saved best agent in a visual test environment
- Shows detailed performance metrics
- Allows interactive testing of the evolved agent

**Features:**
- Visual simulation with the best agent highlighted in green
- Real-time performance metrics (food/minute, efficiency)
- Interactive controls (pause, restart, exit)
- Detailed final performance report

### 4. Evolution Visualization

**What it does:**
- Automatically generates comprehensive plots at the end of simulation
- Saves high-quality graphs showing evolutionary progress
- Provides multiple visualization perspectives on the data

**Generated Plots:**
- **Best Fitness Evolution**: Line plot showing best average fitness over generations with trend line
- **Population Fitness Box Plots**: Box plots showing fitness distribution across generations
- **Survival Rate Evolution**: Line plot showing average survival rates over generations with trend line
- **Evolution Overview Dashboard**: Combined 4-panel view with all key metrics and improvement rates

**Features:**
- High-resolution PNG files (300 DPI)
- Professional styling with grid lines and proper labeling
- Trend analysis with slope calculations
- Automatic sampling for large datasets to avoid overcrowding
- Color-coded visualizations for easy interpretation

## Usage Instructions

### Running the Main Simulation
```bash
python main.py
```
- Run the full evolutionary simulation
- Best agent will be automatically saved as `best_agent.pth` when complete
- Look for "New best agent found!" messages during evolution

### Testing the Best Agent
```bash
python test_best_agent.py
```
- Must run after completing at least one full simulation
- Loads `best_agent.pth` and runs it in a test environment
- Shows detailed performance metrics and visualization

### Manual Best Agent Operations
```python
from evolution import EvolutionManager

# Create evolution manager
evolution_manager = EvolutionManager()

# Save current best agent
evolution_manager.save_best_agent("my_best_agent.pth")

# Load a saved agent
best_agent = evolution_manager.load_best_agent("my_best_agent.pth")
```

### Configuring Offspring Generation
Edit `config.py` to adjust the proportions:
```python
CROSSOVER_PROPORTION = 0.7  # 70% crossover, 30% mutation
SURVIVAL_RATE = 0.2         # Top 20% survive to next generation
```

## Technical Details

### Crossover Implementation
The crossover operator uses element-wise random selection:
```python
# Create a random mask for crossover
mask = torch.rand_like(offspring_param) > 0.5

# Use mask to select weights from either parent1 or parent2
offspring_param.data = torch.where(mask, parent1_param.data, parent2_param.data)
```

### Best Agent Data Structure
Saved agent files contain:
- Neural network weights (complete state dict)
- Fitness score
- Generation when found
- Position and orientation
- Energy and food count

### File Structure
- `neural_network.py` - Added `create_crossover_offspring()` function
- `evolution.py` - Added crossover logic and best agent tracking
- `main.py` - Added automatic best agent saving
- `test_best_agent.py` - New standalone test script
- `best_agent.pth` - Saved best agent file (created after simulation)

## Performance Impact

### Crossover Benefits
- Increases genetic diversity
- Can combine beneficial traits from different agents
- May accelerate evolution by exploring new combinations

### Best Agent Tracking
- Minimal performance overhead
- Preserves best solutions even if population degrades
- Enables analysis of evolutionary progress

## Controls

### Main Simulation
- `SPACE` - Pause/Resume
- `R` - Restart simulation
- `ESC` - Exit

### Best Agent Test
- `SPACE` - Pause/Resume test
- `R` - Restart test
- `ESC` - Exit test

## Expected Behavior

1. **During Evolution:**
   - Console messages when new best agents are found
   - Crossover offspring created when multiple survivors exist
   - Best agent automatically tracked and saved

2. **Best Agent Test:**
   - All agents load the best evolved neural network (homogeneous population)
   - All agents appear identical (blue) since they have the same neural network
   - Complete competitive scenario with all food points and full population
   - Real-time population-wide performance metrics
   - Runs until full duration or automatically restarts when all agents die
   - Detailed final population performance report

3. **File Output:**
   - `best_agent.pth` created after simulation completion
   - Contains complete agent state for later testing/analysis
   - `evolution_plots/` directory created with visualization files:
     - `best_fitness_evolution.png` - Best fitness over generations
     - `population_fitness_boxplots.png` - Population fitness distributions
     - `survival_rate_evolution.png` - Survival rate trends
     - `evolution_overview.png` - Combined dashboard view

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to load best agent"
- Make sure you've run the main simulation first
- Check that `best_agent.pth` exists in the current directory
- Verify the file isn't corrupted

### No crossover occurring
- Check that multiple agents are surviving each generation
- Crossover fills the entire population when survivors > 1
- Single survivor will use mutation-only reproduction
- All crossover offspring receive mutation automatically

### Performance issues
- The new features add minimal overhead
- Best agent tracking uses memory for one additional agent copy
- Crossover computation is lightweight compared to simulation
